I chose to do different themes.  I implemented this, not necessarily with the card images, but with allowing each player to chose their own "theme" that included an accompanying sound for each card flip.

My original feature was sound, consisting of background music and different sounds for a card flip depending on the player's chosen theme.

Beyond the first dialog prompting for a difficulty setting (which just specifies the size of the starting game), instructions on how to run my program can be found under the Rules option in the Information tab on the Menu Bar.  In summary, each player can choose their own personal theme for their designated area using the comboboxes under the player icon.  Starting a new game is accessed from the Game Settings Tab on the menu bar.

All sounds were taken from www.soundjay.com.
All images were vicariously found during google searches OR were drawn (mainly some of the card faces).
